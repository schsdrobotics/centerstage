start: 9:45am | end: 7:45am | duration: 10 hours
estimated: 605 minutes (~10.1 hours) | buffer: none, taken out of testing

- set-up [1 hour]
  - intaking pixels [30 min]
    - determine the angle for each pixel on the stack empirically [20 min]
    - ramp slowly downwards [10 min]

  - aligning with stacks [30 min]
    - utilize april tags [10 min]
    - pid to center [20 min]

- testing for all : (close, far) * (red, blue) [3 hours]
  - 30 min of testing per
  - 4 types of tests
  - 3 stages of opmodes

- 2+0 [1.25 hours]
  - purple pixel [30 minutes]
    - create meepmeep path for each mark [15 minutes]
    - intake purple pixel out [15 minutes]

  - yellow pixel [30 minutes]
    - rely on odometry to just go to the right spot

  - test for all

  - constrain under 5 seconds [15 min]

- 2+2 / 2+3 [55 min]
  - intake 2 from stacks [20 min]

  - score the 2 onto the backdrop [20 min]
    - sidegame
    - strafe with sidegame to drop them nicely
    - current detection?

  - test for all
 
  - constrain under 12 seconds [15 min]

- 2+4 / 2+5 [55 min]
  - go back to original stack, intake 2 more [20 min]
  - score these two [20 min]
  
  - test for all
  
  - should be constrained to exactly 30 seconds [15 min]
    - preloads + cycle + cycle + park = 30s
    -    5s    +  12s  +  12s  +  1s  = 30s
